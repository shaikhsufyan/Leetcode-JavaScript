✔ When navigating Home → About

About component mounts (first time it appears)

Home component unmounts (gets removed from screen)

✔ When navigating About → Home

Home component mounts (shows again)

About component unmounts (removed)

🔥 So the correct flow is:
Home → About

❌ Home UNMOUNT

✔ About MOUNT

About → Home

❌ About UNMOUNT

✔ Home MOUNT
